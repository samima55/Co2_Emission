## Introduction

This project offers a hands-on experience in coding and data analysis, simulating a corporate development environment. You will work on Python applications to analyze CO2 emissions data for different countries. Your task is to create, execute, and refine Python code to perform this analysis.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Perform data analysis on CO2 emissions data for various countries.
- **Tools**: Python, data analysis libraries, code comparison with expert-designed code.
- **Learning Outcomes**: Gain practical experience in coding, data analysis, and collaboration in a corporate-style development setting.

## Data

The project data includes:

- A structured dataset containing CO2 emissions data for all countries.
- A list of years 1997- 2010 for which emissions data is available.

## Analysis

The Python code for data analysis includes functionalities to:

- Extract the index of a specific year.
- Find the country with the highest and lowest CO2 emissions for a given year.
- Calculate the average CO2 emissions for a specific year.
